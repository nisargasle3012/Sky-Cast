# Sky-Cast
Sky-Cast is basically a Weather-forecasting website, I have used an openweather API to fetch data.
Enter the city name for which you want to know weather information and then click on proceed, input field is required.
If the entered city is correct it will lead to a success page where date, time, city name, country code and weather information data will be available.
There "HOME" button is available on success page, by clicking on which we will be redirected to home page.
If the entered city name is incorrect or information of that city is not available in the API, clicking on proceed will lead to a failure page.
Failure page also consists of "HOME" button, again by clicking on which you will be redirected to home page.
Website consists of frontend with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework whereas backend consists of Express and Node js and API to fetch data from.
Also can visit to site (deployed by Cyclic):-  https://good-jade-pig-vest.cyclic.app/
